- name: !!str Austin Siamese Rescue
  email: !!str loveasiamese@yahoo.com
  about: !!str Founded on the belief that all life should be valued and treated with dignity and respect, Austin Siamese Rescue, Inc. has a long-term commitment to responsible rescue, rehabilitation and the re-homing of Siamese cats and their non-Siamese companions in the Central Texas area. All of the cats fostered in Austin are cared for in private homes by individuals who dedicate their spare time to this effort. Our cats come from a variety of backgrounds. Some faced death at the shelter, while others came from abusive and neglectful households. Still others were treasured companions of guardians who could no longer care for them. What they all have in common is a need for a forever home, where they can live their lives as the happy, pampered cats they all deserve to be. We're looking for the perfect inside home for them
